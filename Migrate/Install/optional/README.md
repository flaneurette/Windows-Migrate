# Readme

Some software versions might not exists anymore when you install it, or need to be updated after running the .bat installation files. Always be sure to download the latest version of the software. 
These are just (network) helper scripts.

# Uses

- These bat files install common, popular or new software that is recommended to many users/developers in 2025/2026. 
- Only install what you recognize. 
- If you are curious about certain software, use a search engine to find out more about it.

Currently these bat installers can install:

- Portmaster (a very good firewall for AMD users. Check their website if you use intel)
- NextDNS (recommended DNS for all users)
- Stirling PDF (a recommended free Acrobat alternative)
- Putty (mainly for developers: terminal emulator)
- WinSCP (mainly for developers: secure copy)
